Researchpy Postestimation Methods

This submodule contains postestimation methods and diagnostics for fitted models including:

- LikelihoodRatioTest: Likelihood ratio test for model comparison (alias: LRTest)

Future methods to be added:
- Wald tests
- Score tests
- Goodness-of-fit tests
- Residual diagnostics
- Influence measures
- etc.

Usage:
    from researchpy.models.postestimation import LikelihoodRatioTest
    # or use the alias
    from researchpy.models.postestimation import LRTest

    # Compare fitted model to null (intercept-only)
    lr_test = LikelihoodRatioTest(fitted_model)
    lr_test.results()

    # Compare two nested models
    lr_test = LikelihoodRatioTest(full_model, restricted_model=reduced_model)
    lr_test.summary()
