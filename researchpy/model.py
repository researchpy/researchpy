Researchpy Model Module

This module provides the base model class for Researchpy regression models.

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
    The `model` class in this module is maintained for backward compatibility with v0.3.7.
    It will be deprecated in a future version. New code should use:

        from researchpy.models import CoreModel, GeneralModel
        from researchpy.models.multivariable import LogisticRegression
        # or use aliases
        from researchpy.models.multivariable import Logistic

    The new modular structure provides better organization and more functionality.

    This is the base -model- object for Researchpy. By default, missing
    observations are dropped from the data. -matrix_type- parameter determines
    which design matrix will be returned; value of 1 will return a design matrix
    with the intercept, while a value of 0 will not.
